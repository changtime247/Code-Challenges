// 7 kyu
// You're a square!

// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// -1  -->  false
//  0  -->  true
//  3  -->  false
//  4  -->  true
// 25  -->  true
// 26  -->  false

// ----------------------
// parameters: given integer
// return whether the integer is a perfect square (meaning, the square root of the parameter equals an integer)
// examples:
// -1  -->  false
//  0  -->  true
//  1  -->  true
//  4  -->  true
//  9  -->  true
// 25  -->  true
// 26  -->  false
// 30  -->  false
// 35  -->  false
// pseudocode: if the square root of the parameter is an integer, then the parameter is a perfect square

var isSquare = function(n){
    return Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n));
